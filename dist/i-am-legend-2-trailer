        <p>As for the &#34;I Am Legend 2&#34; trailer video — or &#34;I M LEGEND 2: End Chapter,&#34; as the YouTube video title reads — it&#39;s a concept trailer. The description under the video calls it a &#34;concept teaser trailer.&#34; In other words, it was simply created for entertainment purposes by a fan.</p>
        
        <p>Aside from the fake trailer, it&#39;s true Smith and Jordan will star in a sequel to the original film, according to Variety . The entertainment-news publisher reported in December 2023 Smith said the new film will follow an alternate ending included on the DVD for the first movie, rather than the theatrical ending. An official title and release date had not yet been announced as of April 2024.</p>
