        <p>NOT On April 19, 2024, 14-time Grammy Award winner Taylor Swift released a double album, &#34;The Tortured Poets Department: The Anthology.&#34; In one of the 31 songs, &#34;I Hate It Here,&#34; the second verse allegedly read:</p>
        
        <p>My friends used to play a game where</p>
        
        <p>We would pick a decade</p>
        
        <p>We wished we could live in instead of this</p>
        
        <p>I&#39;d say the 1830s but without all the racists</p>
        
        <p>Backlash ensued on X (formerly Twitter), with users questioning whether the lyrics were real. One post, by X user @ghostijn, garnered more than 6.3 million views and 25,000 likes, as of this writing. &#34;This can&#39;t actually be real ?&#34; One user commented. &#34;IS THIS REAL ??&#34; Another wrote.</p>
        
        <p>&#34;There is no way these are the real lyrics…right?&#34; Another X user posted, quickly gaining more than 6.5 million views, as of this writing.</p>
        
        <p>The lyric is in fact authentic and can be viewed on the official Genius lyrics page [archived here ], as well as heard in the song itself on standard music streaming platforms.</p>
        
        <p>Swift&#39;s official YouTube account also posted the song [archived here ]; the second verse can be heard at minute 1:15.</p>
        
        <p>A &#34;megathread&#34; also emerged on Reddit entirely devoted to &#34;I Hate It Here,&#34; with many users analyzing the 1830s lyric. While many comments pushed back against the lyrics – &#34;Such an awful and tone deaf lyric. She really becomes more removed from reality every year&#34; – others were confused as to why Swift would romanticize an era of death and disease. &#34;What about the tuberculosis Taylor,&#34; one wrote.</p>
        
        <p>We&#39;ve previously written other stories about Swift, including that she sang background vocals on Beyoncé&#39;s &#34;Cowboy Carter&#34; album , and that she and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein were photographed together.</p>
