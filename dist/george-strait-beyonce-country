        <p>NOT On April 10, 2024, the Facebook page of America&#39;s Last Line of Defense published an article positing that singer-songwriter George Strait had dismissed Beyoncé as a country artist ( archived ):</p>
        
        <p>Nashville Legend George Strait Weighs in on Beyonce [sic]: &#34;Playing Dress-Up Don&#39;t Make You Country&#34;</p>
        
        <p>&#34;I listened to it for as long as I could,&#34; Strait told us in an exclusive interview, &#34;The best part about it was when it ended.&#34;</p>
        
        <p>Strait says he&#39;ll fight against the album receiving nominations at any country awards show.</p>
